# Your Expo App

This project is a simple mobile application built with Expo and React Native. It demonstrates the use of a bottom tab navigator to switch between two screens: Home and About. This app serves as a basic framework for more complex mobile applications developed with Expo.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com/)) installed on your computer.
- [Expo CLI](https://expo.io/tools#cli) by running `npm install -g expo-cli` if you haven't already.
- The Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device to run your app on a physical device, or a simulator/emulator installed on your computer.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/el-riber/new21.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd your-expo-app

3. Install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install

4.Start the development server:
```bash
npm start

After running the above command, a new browser window will open with the Expo developer tools. You can then scan the QR code with the Expo Go app or run the app on an emulator/simulator.

Usage
The app contains two tabs at the bottom:

Home: Displays the Home Screen.
About: Displays information about the app.
You can switch between these tabs using the tab navigator at the bottom of the screen.
